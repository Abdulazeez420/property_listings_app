API Integration
The application communicates with a RESTful API using these primary endpoints:

GET /properties - Retrieves paginated property listings

Supports query parameters: page, min_price, max_price, location, status

GET /properties/{id} - Fetches detailed information for a specific property

POST /properties/{id}/images - Handles property image uploads

Example API call implementation:

dart
Future<List<Property>> fetchProperties({
  int page = 1,
  double? minPrice,
  double? maxPrice,
  String? location
}) async {
  final response = await dio.get(
    '/properties',
    queryParameters: {
      'page': page,
      if (minPrice != null) 'min_price': minPrice,
      if (maxPrice != null) 'max_price': maxPrice,
      if (location != null) 'location': location,
    }
  );
  // ... parse response ...
}
Analytics Implementation
The application tracks detailed user interactions through a custom analytics service that records:

Property Views:

Time spent viewing each property

Scroll depth and interaction patterns

View frequency and recency

User Actions:

Search filter usage

Sharing activities

Image uploads

Performance Metrics:

API response times

Image load performance

Screen transition durations

Example tracking implementation:

dart
void trackPropertyView(String propertyId, Duration viewDuration) {
  analytics.trackEvent(
    'property_view',
    parameters: {
      'property_id': propertyId,
      'duration_seconds': viewDuration.inSeconds,
      'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    }
  );
}
